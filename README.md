# Bit Manipulation

This is a single-header C++17 library for manipulating bits.

It implements many of Sean Eron Anderson's [Bit Twiddling Hacks](https://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html)
and adds some more unique ones on top of that.

Most of the implementations are templated and designed for any integer type.
All of the implementations are `constexpr`.

## Configuration

You will find a `USER CONFIGURATION` section at the top of the header file.
Uncomment `#define` lines in this section to customize this library to your own needs.

## License

See the `LICENSE` file.
